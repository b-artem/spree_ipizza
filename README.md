Spree Ipizza
===========

This is really lame spree extension to work with Estonian banks written by Rails newbie :P
Two things: it works, and it may be completely wrong, unoptimal and can ruin your system/wealth etc.

This extension uses ipizza gem by priihaamer and based on spree_webmoney as example, so there can remain leftowers from spree_webmoney. Feel free to fork, fix, and I would be really happy if you will make a pull request for your changes.

Example
=======

Example will be added later.
